           <h2>Five Places I've Traveled to in 2024</h2>

                   <br><br>
                   My boyfriend and I spent our spring break in Santa Cruz and we had fun exploring the town and hanging out on the boardwalk.

                   <br><br>
                   Once the spring semester ended, I visited my best friend who is going to UCSD. It was my first time in San Diego so she showed me around her favorite spots.
               </li>
               <br><br>

                   <br><br>
                   For my birthday, my boyfriend and I had a weekend getaway to Bolinas and it was very peaceful and relaxing.
               </li>
               <br><br>
               <li><strong>Monroe</strong>

                   <br><br>
                   In July, my mom, sister, and I went to Monroe, Louisiana for a family reunion. It was my first family reunion since I was 4 years old!

               <br><br>
               <li><strong>Chicago</strong>

                   <br><br>
                   My dad moved to Chicago a couple years ago so in August I flew out there with my sister and my boyfriend to attend his wedding! It was a very small ceremony with friends and family on their roof deck and we had so much fun.
