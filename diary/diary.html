           <ul>
               <li><strong>Santa Cruz</strong>
                   <img src="img/santaCruz.png" alt="Overlooking Monterey Bay from a grassy cliff on a foggy day, surfers dot the water with the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk in the distance.">
                   My boyfriend and I spent our spring break in Santa Cruz and we had fun exploring the town and hanging out on the boardwalk.
               </li>
               <li><strong>San Diego</strong>
                   <img src="img/sanDiego.png" alt="Uma poses in front of a cloudy sunset at Windansea Beach in San Diego.">
                   Once the spring semester ended, I visited my best friend who is going to UCSD. It was my first time in San Diego so she showed me around her favorite spots.
               </li>
               <li><strong>Bolinas</strong>
                   <img src="img/bolinas.png" alt="Looking out at Mount Tamalpais under a clear blue sky from the sandy shore of Bolinas Beach.">
                   For my birthday, my boyfriend and I had a weekend getaway to Bolinas and it was very peaceful and relaxing.
               </li>
               <li><strong>Monroe</strong>
                   <img src="img/monroe.png" alt="Grace and nine family members smile as they sit inside at a grey table. All are wearing yellow shirts with a blue graphic marking their 2024 family reunion.">
                   In July, my mom, sister, and I went to Monroe, Louisiana for a family reunion. It was my first family reunion since I was 4 years old!
               </li>
               <li><strong>Chicago</strong>
                   <img src="img/chicago.png" alt="Bride and groom pose in a short white dress and light colored suit with a man and two women in formal wear holding bouquets in front of the Chicago skyline.">
                   My dad moved to Chicago a couple years ago so in August I flew out there with my sister and my boyfriend to attend his wedding! It was a very small ceremony with friends and family on their roof deck and we had so much fun.
