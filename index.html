            <h1>Introducing Grace</h1>
            <p>Welcome to my portfolio! I'm a third year visual communications major and marketing minor here at San Francisco State University. I'm a Cancer Sun and Moon and the oldest of two sisters. I was born in Brooklyn, New York but I moved to the Bay Area when I was a kid and now I'm living in El Cerrito which is a small city located between Richmond and Berkeley. I love arts and crafts, spending time with friends and family, and hanging out with my dog Linguini. I enjoy trying new restaurants and bars and my favorite cuisines include Mexican, Japanese, and Italian. When I'm relaxing I like to watch TV shows like RuPaul's Drag Race, Sex and the City, and whatever new crime documentary is on Netflix.</p>
